```
ls, cat, echo, pwd, grep, touch, mkdir, rmdir,
cp, mv, head, tail, wc, sort, uniq, find, which,
date, whoami, hostname, sleep, clear
```

### 3. Command Blacklist (dangerous commands blocked)
```
sudo, su, rm, chmod, chown, mkfs, dd, mount,
umount, reboot, shutdown, halt, init, killall, pkill
```

### 4. File System Restrictions
```
✓ All file operations restricted to sandbox/ directory
✓ Cannot access /etc, /tmp, /home, etc.
✓ Path validation using realpath()
✓ Read-only access to /bin for executables
```

### 5. Real-time Monitoring
```
✓ Tracks commands executed
✓ Tracks commands blocked
✓ Shows runtime statistics
✓ Color-coded security alerts
```

## 🚀 How to Run (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Build
```bash
make
```

### Step 2: Run GUI
```bash
python3 sandbox_gui.py
```

### Step 3: Try Commands
```bash
sandbox> help
sandbox> echo "Hello World!" > test.txt
sandbox> cat test.txt

## 📊 What to Demonstrate

### For Your Professor/TA:

#### 1. Visual Interface (30 seconds)
- Open the GUI - show the orange border and header
- Point out "SANDBOXED SHELL ENVIRONMENT" title
- Show security features listed in header
- Highlight real-time statistics

#### 2. Basic Functionality (1 minute)
```bash
sandbox> help              # Show available commands
sandbox> pwd               # Show current directory
sandbox> echo "test" > f.txt  # Create file
sandbox> cat f.txt         # Read file
sandbox> ls | grep txt     # Pipeline
```

#### 3. Security - Command Whitelist (1 minute)
```bash
sandbox> ls                # ✅ Allowed
sandbox> python3           # ❌ Blocked (not whitelisted)
sandbox> vim              # ❌ Blocked (not whitelisted)
```

#### 4. Security - Command Blacklist (1 minute)
```bash
sandbox> sudo ls          # ❌ Blocked (security risk)
sandbox> rm -rf /         # ❌ Blocked (security risk)
sandbox> chmod 777 f.txt  # ❌ Blocked (security risk)
```

#### 5. Security - Path Restrictions (1 minute)
```bash
sandbox> cd /etc          # ❌ Blocked (outside sandbox)
sandbox> cat /etc/passwd  # ❌ Blocked (outside sandbox)
sandbox> mkdir test       # ✅ Allowed (in sandbox)
sandbox> cd test          # ✅ Allowed (in sandbox)
```

#### 6. Statistics (30 seconds)
```bash
sandbox> stats
# Shows:
# - Runtime: X seconds
# - Commands executed: Y
# - Commands blocked: Z
```

## 📝 Presentation Tips

### Opening (30 seconds)
"I've created a sandboxed Unix shell with comprehensive security features and a visual terminal interface. The orange border and header clearly indicate we're in a sandboxed environment."

### Core Features (2 minutes)
"The shell implements five major security features:
1. Resource limits prevent DoS attacks
2. Command whitelisting ensures only safe commands run
3. Command blacklisting blocks dangerous operations
4. Path restrictions prevent system file access
5. Real-time monitoring tracks all activity"

### Live Demo (3 minutes)
- Show normal commands working
- Show dangerous commands being blocked
- Show path restrictions in action
- Show statistics

### Technical Details (1 minute)
"The implementation uses setrlimit() for resource constraints, realpath() for path validation, and fork/exec for process management. The GUI uses pygame with threading for async communication with the shell process."

### Closing (30 seconds)
"This demonstrates practical application of OS concepts including process management, security, and system calls, while providing a professional user interface."
